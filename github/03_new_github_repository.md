## 3. Creating a new repository on GitHub and cloning it to your local machine

Often times, you'll be working with code that someone has already worked on and published to GitHub. In this case, you'll want to clone the repository to your local machine so you can make changes to it. Cloning a repository creates a copy of the repository on your local machine, including all the files and the entire history of the project.

### Exercise 3.1

This exercise will guide you through creating a new repository on GitHub and cloning it to your local machine.

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository called `my-github-repo`.
2. When creating your repository, be sure to check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README". This will create a `README.md` file in your repository.
3. Copy the URL of the repository.
4. In your terminal, navigate to a directory where you want to clone the repository.
5. Run `git clone <url>` to clone the repository to your local machine. Replace `<url>` with the URL of your repository.
6. Navigate into the `my-github-repo` directory. Notice that there is a `README.md` file in the directory. This is the file that was created when you initialized the repository on GitHub.
7. Try making some changes to the `README.md` file, adding the changes to the staging area, committing the changes, and pushing them to GitHub.

Congratualtions! You've created a new repository on GitHub and cloned it to your local machine.
