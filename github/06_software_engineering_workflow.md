## 6. A software engineering workflow using GitHub

In this section, we will simulate a typical software engineering workflow using GitHub. This workflow will include creating a new branch, making changes to the branch, creating a pull request, and merging the changes into the main branch.

To get started, be sure you've cloned the `github-workshop` repository to your local machine. You can find it at [https://github.com/wcucs/github-workshop](https://github.com/wcucs/github-workshop).

1. **Create a new branch**: Before we start making changes to the code, we'll create a new branch to work on. This is a good practice because it allows us to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the `main` branch. Create a new branch with your username as the name of the branch.
2. **Make some changes**: Now that you're on your new branch, open the file `calculator.py`. This code is buggy. See if you can identify the problem and fix it.
3. **Add, commit, and push**: Once you've made your changes, add them to the staging area, commit them, and push them to GitHub. Be sure to make your commit message meaningful; it should describe the changes you made or the problem you fixed.
4. **Create a pull request**: Go to your repository on GitHub and create a pull request to merge your changes from your new branch into the `main` branch. Be sure to add a title and description for your pull request.
5. **Review and merge**: At this stage, a PR manager will review the changes. If the changes are approved, you will be able to merge your changes into the main branch. Once the changes are merged, you can delete your branch if you'd like.

Congratulations! You've completed a software engineering workflow using GitHub. This is a simplified version of what you might encounter in a professional setting, but it covers the basics of working with branches, pull requests, and merging changes. These are fundamental concepts that you will use in your day-to-day work as a student and as a software engineer.
