## 4. Collaborating with others on GitHub

[Home](README.md)

One of the most powerful features of GitHub is its ability to facilitate collaboration between developers. GitHub provides tools for managing issues, reviewing code, and merging changes from multiple contributors. This section will cover some of the basics of collaborating with others on GitHub.

### Exercise 4.1

First, let's suppose you're working on a project, and your project partner lets you know that they've made some changes to the code. You'll want to pull those changes to your local machine so you can work with the most up-to-date version of the code.

1. Clone the following repository to your local machine: [https://github.com/wcucs/github-workshop](https://github.com/wcucs/github-workshop).
2. Navigate into the `github-workshop` directory. What does the `README.md` file say?
3. Now, I'll make a change to the file from my machine.
4. Run `git pull` to pull the changes from the remote repository to your local repository. What does the `README.md` file say now?

Congratulations! You've pulled changes from a remote repository to your local repository. This is what the majority of your GitHub workflow will look like when working with other people: making changes to the code, pushing them to GitHub, and pulling changes from GitHub to your local machine.
