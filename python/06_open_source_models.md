## 6. Exploring Open-Source Models for Machine Learning and NLP

[Home](README.md)

[Back: Working with Hugging Face Transformers](05_hugging_face_transformers.md)

In this section, we will explore a variety of open-source models that you can use for machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). These models are free to use and can be easily integrated into your projects. We will cover models in areas such as large language models (LLMs), computer vision, and natural language processing, with practical examples of how to load and use them.

### Before We Continue

Before you begin using open-source models, you should have Python, `pip`, and the necessary libraries (such as Hugging Face’s `transformers`, `torch`, or `tensorflow`) installed.

### Overview of Open-Source Models

Open-source models are pre-trained machine learning models that are freely available for use in a wide variety of tasks. Some of the most well-known platforms for finding and using open-source models include:

- **Hugging Face Model Hub**: Contains thousands of models for NLP, computer vision, and more.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: Offers models optimized for TensorFlow.
- **PyTorch Hub**: Provides models that are ready to use with PyTorch.

We’ll focus on Hugging Face’s Model Hub in this section, but we’ll also introduce other platforms where you can access open-source models.

### Loading Open-Source NLP Models

Open-source models for NLP include large language models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT, and their variants. Let’s start by loading some popular open-source models from Hugging Face.

#### Example 1: GPT-Neo (EleutherAI)

GPT-Neo is an open-source alternative to OpenAI’s GPT-3. It is a great option for text generation tasks.

1. **Loading GPT-Neo for text generation**:

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   # Load the GPT-Neo model and tokenizer
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")

   # Define a prompt for text generation
   prompt = "The future of artificial intelligence is"
   inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

   # Generate text
   outputs = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=50)
   generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
   print(generated_text)
   ```

#### Example 2: BLOOM (BigScience)

BLOOM is an open-source multilingual LLM that is trained to work in many languages.

1. **Loading BLOOM for text generation**:

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   # Load the BLOOM model and tokenizer
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("bigscience/bloom-560m")
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bigscience/bloom-560m")

   # Define a prompt in English
   prompt = "Artificial intelligence in healthcare"
   inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

   # Generate text
   outputs = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=50)
   generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
   print(generated_text)
   ```

2. **Multilingual Text Generation**:

   Try inputting a prompt in another language, such as French or Spanish, to see how BLOOM handles multilingual text generation.

### Loading Open-Source Computer Vision Models

Open-source models are also available for computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Let’s explore some popular computer vision models.

#### Example 3: ResNet (PyTorch)

ResNet is a popular model for image classification. Let’s use the PyTorch framework to load and use a pre-trained ResNet model.

1. **Loading ResNet for image classification**:

   ```python
   import torch
   from torchvision import models, transforms
   from PIL import Image

   # Load the pre-trained ResNet model
   model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
   model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode

   # Define a transformation to resize and normalize the image
   preprocess = transforms.Compose([
       transforms.Resize(256),
       transforms.CenterCrop(224),
       transforms.ToTensor(),
       transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
   ])

   # Load an image and preprocess it
   img = Image.open("sample_image.jpg")
   img_tensor = preprocess(img).unsqueeze(0)

   # Make a prediction
   with torch.no_grad():
       output = model(img_tensor)
       _, predicted_class = output.max(1)
   print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class.item()}")
   ```

   - **ResNet**: A state-of-the-art image classification model available in PyTorch’s model hub.

#### Example 4: YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)

YOLOv5 is an open-source model for object detection. You can use it to detect objects in images or videos.

1. **Using YOLOv5 for object detection**:

   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
   ```

   ```python
   from ultralytics import YOLO

   # Load the YOLOv5 model
   model = YOLO('yolov5s')

   # Perform object detection on an image
   results = model("sample_image.jpg")

   # Show the detection results
   results.show()
   ```

   - YOLOv5 is fast and accurate for real-time object detection tasks.

### Exploring Open-Source Models for Fine-Tuning

Many open-source models can be fine-tuned on custom datasets to suit specific tasks. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to your own dataset, which can be especially useful in domain-specific applications.

#### Example 5: Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification

Let’s briefly explore how you might fine-tune a BERT model for text classification. While full fine-tuning is beyond the scope of this workshop, this example will show the basic process.

1. **Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification**:

   ```python
   from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
   from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

   # Load a pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
   model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

   # Define a dataset (dummy example for simplicity)
   train_texts = ["I love this!", "This is awful."]
   train_labels = [1, 0]
   encodings = tokenizer(train_texts, truncation=True, padding=True)

   # Create a trainer for fine-tuning
   training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./results", num_train_epochs=1)
   trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=encodings)

   # Fine-tune the model (this is a simplified example)
   trainer.train()
   ```

2. **Try Fine-Tuning Other Models**:

   You can fine-tune other Hugging Face models using a similar process, adapting the model to your own data.

### Exercise 6.1: Choose an Open-Source Model and Perform Inference

1. **Choose a model from Hugging Face Model Hub** or PyTorch Hub (such as a GPT model, BLOOM, ResNet, etc.).

2. **Perform inference** on a text or image task of your choice, such as:

   - Text generation with GPT-Neo.
   - Sentiment analysis with BERT.
   - Image classification with ResNet.
   - Object detection with YOLOv5.

3. **Experiment with different prompts or images** to see how the models perform on various inputs.

### Exercise 6.2: Fine-Tune a Pre-Trained Model (Optional)

1. **Choose a pre-trained model** from Hugging Face and fine-tune it on a small dataset (such as text classification or sentiment analysis).

2. **Train the model** on the dataset for one or two epochs and evaluate its performance.

In this section, we explored various open-source models available for machine learning and NLP tasks, ranging from GPT-Neo for text generation to ResNet for image classification. These models can be easily accessed through platforms like Hugging Face, PyTorch Hub, and TensorFlow Hub, making them valuable resources for quick project development.
