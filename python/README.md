## 0. Preface: Why Python?

Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used in the field of data science and machine learning. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners. Python has a large number of libraries that are specifically designed for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

Python's syntax is simple and easy to learn, making it the perfect choice for programmers who want to quickly put together projects and learn new concepts. Python is also a great choice for experienced programmers who want to prototype new ideas and algorithms.

This workshop assumes that you have installed Python and PIP. If you haven't, you can download Python from the official website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). PIP is a package manager for Python that allows you to install libraries and tools. You can find more information about PIP at [https://pypi.org/project/pip/](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
