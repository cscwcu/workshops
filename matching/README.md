# matching

This is a set of matching problems used for one of our bi-weekly CS Club meetings. We have multiple sets of 20 problems, where we use the source code and have members match to the correct output.

Meeting to be held on September 15th, ran by Kaushal Patel, Zach Eanes, and Joseph Oladeji.
